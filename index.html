         Residential classification of bristol urban area using administrative data
         </a> - generation of a geodemographic classification for the year 2005
         (approximately mid-way between censuses) using only administrative data at
         Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) granularity. The classification intent is to describe
         residential property types, life states of typical occupants (pensioners, families,
         childless working adults, unemployed) and level of affluence.

         a methodology for automated extraction of recorded time-series
         rainfall data (from UK MetOffice) for specified locations
         (typically river catchment areas). Demonstrated using a simple hydrological
         model which is compared against actual flow data measurements. (3.3 MB PDF)</li>
