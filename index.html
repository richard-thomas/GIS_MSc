   <h4>DISSERTATION: "Determining cycle mode choice for commuting using new fine-grained route analysis methods"</h4>

      <li>ABSTRACT: <i>"Previous research has shown that the likelihood of choosing
      to commute by bicycle can be very dependent on the availability of
      acceptable cycle routes of reasonable distance, avoiding hills and with a
      minimum of cycling in motorized traffic. Several papers have also
      highlighted this is an aspect that has been difficult to measure
      effectively and thus is often done using indirect methods such as summing
      quantity of cycle infrastructure within an area. Transport simulation
      models have historically focused on motorized traffic and thus often do
      not have enough detail at a small street level to be representative for
      modeling non-motorized traffic. Taking the UK city of Bristol as a basis
      for analysis, this study looks at a method of combining route cost
      functions (derived from third party cycle-specific routing software) for a
      large number of realistic commuting journeys. To overcome availability
      limitations on small area census commuting data, an additional method is
      developed to generate representative synthetic commuting
      origin-destination flow data at a fine spatial granularity using the
      census data that is available as constraints."</i></li>
