   The city of Leeds in West Yorkshire grew at a remarkable rate during the nineteenth century
   largely due to playing a key part in the Industrial Revolution within the UK. With the
   growing population, industrialisation and civic development, the city expanded across the
   landscape. Amongst other things, this resulted in a treasure-trove of Victorian architecture.
   This website aims to highlight a number of on-line resources that document the expansion and
   history of the city, with a particular focus on providing a mapping tool to explore the
   distribution of the architectural legacy left behind.
